🚀 Project Spotlight: AI-Cloud Synergy Feedback Platform
🧠💬 Sentiment Analysis | 🌩️ AWS | 🤖 NLP with RoBERTa & VADER | 📱 React Native

Proud to share my capstone project – a scalable, cloud-based sentiment analysis platform designed specifically for SMEs to gain real-time insights from customer feedback.

Although this project appears to be a group submission, I independently conceptualized, developed, and delivered the entire architecture — from infrastructure to AI models to the frontend. Yes, every single line of code and every milestone was my own.

🔍 Key Highlights:

📊 Integrated RoBERTa and VADER models for real-time sentiment analysis.

🌐 Built a cloud-native infrastructure using Amazon S3, SageMaker, and Lambda.

📱 Developed a cross-platform mobile app with React Native.

🔁 End-to-end data pipeline: Collection → Preprocessing → Prediction → Visualization.

📈 Fine-tuned transformer models for better accuracy in domain-specific feedback.

💡 Why this matters:
Many SMEs struggle with the cost and complexity of extracting value from customer reviews. This platform offers them a cost-effective, serverless, and accurate AI-driven solution.

📌 Lessons learned: ✅ Deep cloud integration with AWS
✅ Transformer-based model training & deployment
✅ Real-world project management and ownership
✅ Building usable, non-technical interfaces

🔗 I’m excited about AI, NLP, and building tools that create real impact. If you’re in this space—or know someone who is—I’d love to connect, collaborate, or explore opportunities!

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?
